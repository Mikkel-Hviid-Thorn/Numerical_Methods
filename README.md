# Numerical_Methods
This repository contains different programs relating to Numerical Methods. The module 'numeriske_metoder' contains many basic methods from Numerical Analysis such as numerical differentiation and integration with use in numerical solutions of ODE's. The module also contains some polynomial approximations. The other files are more specific with 'optimize_case' and 'gradient_descent_methods' concerning optimization of a function with the steepest descent gradient method and 'phase_space_portrait' being designed to plot phase space portraits of two dimensional autonomous homogeneous differential equation.

The module 'numeriske_metoder' is largely based on the course 'computerstøttede beregninger' at AAU and the following sources:
- P. Turner, T. Arildsen, K. Kavanagh (2018). Applied Scientific Computing with Python. Springer. ISBN 9783319895758.
- H. P. Langtangen (2016). A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python. Springer, 5th edition. ISBN 9783662498873.

Both the 'optimize_case', 'phase_space_portrait', and scripts in 'approximative_weak_solutions' are ad hoc programmes made for a certain purpose. Thus sources for these algorithms are various parts of lectures and websites.

The programme 'gradient_descent_methods' is largely based on the course 'optimering' at AAU and the following source:
- N. Andréasson, A. Evgrafov, M. Patriksson (2019). An Introduction to Continuous Optimization: Foundations & Fundamental Algorithms. Dover, 3rd edition. ISBN 
  9780486802879.

Some text is in danish, especially in the file 'numeriske_metoder'.
