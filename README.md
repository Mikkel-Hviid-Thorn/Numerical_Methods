# Numerical_Methods
This repository contains different programs relating to Numerical Methods. The module 'numeriske_metoder' contains many basic methods from Numerical Analysis such as numerical differentiation and integration with use in numerical solutions of ODE's. The module also contains some polynomial approximations. The other two files are more specific with 'optimize' concerning optimization of a function with the steepest descent gradient method and 'phase_space_portrait' being designed to plot phase space portraits of two dimensional autonomous homogeneous differential equation.

Some text is in danish, especially in the file 'numeriske_metoder'.
